# InfoCom Drone Project - Part 6 -Interaction with Drones

In this lab you will continue with your own code made for the previous lab, Multi-drone System. But you need to replace the old `index.html` file with the one provided in `/templates/index.html` of this repo.

## Optional
A new `simulator.py` file is provided in `/pi`, which is cleaner and easier to understand (perhaps). You can use your own old `simulator.py` from Lab2 or replace it with the new one. If you want to use the new file, remember to put the changes you made on your own for Lab2 in this new file as well.

## /pygame-music
In this lab we will need to play some sounds in the background while the drone is in different status. `pygame` is a new Python package we will use to play music. Take a look at the document in this folder and try to integrate it in `simulator.py`.
